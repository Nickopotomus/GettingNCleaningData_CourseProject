Participant_ID: Participant identification number (1-30)

Activity_ID
1 - walking
2 - walking upstairs
3 - walking downstairs
4 - sitting
5 - standing
6 - laying

Domain - referes to domain used in original calculations (time or frequency)
Component - identifies motion component being quantified (body motion or gravitational)
Instrument - identifies accelerometer or gyroscope


Variables captured:

1. Acceleration_XYZ - linear/angular acceleration in X/Y/Z direction (as identified)
